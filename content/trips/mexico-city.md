# Mexico City

## La Ciudad de los Palacios

Mexico City is a sprawling metropolis built on the ruins of Tenochtitlan, the ancient Aztec capital. With over 21 million people in the metro area, it's one of the largest cities in the Western Hemisphere — a dizzying mix of pre-Columbian history, colonial architecture, and contemporary culture.

> "Mexico City is not a city you visit. It's a city that happens to you."

**What makes it special:** The layers. Every neighborhood is its own world. The food alone could take a lifetime to explore.
