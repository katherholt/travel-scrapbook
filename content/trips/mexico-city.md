# Mexico City

## La Ciudad de los Palacios

Mexico City feels indulgent in the most layered way — sensory, romantic, and endlessly alive. There is a softness beneath the scale of the city, especially in neighborhoods like Condesa where tree-lined streets, long meals, and quiet cafes slow everything down. The experience is lush rather than chaotic, rewarding curiosity with beautiful food, cultural depth, and moments that feel unexpectedly intimate.

**What makes it special:** The layers. Every neighborhood is its own world. The food alone could take a lifetime to explore.
