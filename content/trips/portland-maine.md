# Portland, Maine

## A Coastal New England Gem

Portland feels like a quiet coastal reset. It is cozy, nature-forward, and best experienced slowly, especially in the late morning when the fog lifts and the harbor feels soft and alive. The city is ideal for romantic wandering, seafood rituals, and discovering small pockets of charm rather than chasing big attractions.

**What makes it special:** The scale. You can walk from the art museum to a lobster shack to a craft cocktail bar in fifteen minutes. The ocean is always visible. The pace is unhurried.
