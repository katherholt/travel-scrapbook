# Portland, Maine

## A Coastal New England Gem

Portland sits on a peninsula jutting into Casco Bay, a working waterfront city that punches well above its weight in food, art, and character. Once a shipping hub for lumber and fish, it burned to the ground in 1866 and rebuilt itself in handsome red brick — the same Victorian architecture that lines the Old Port today.

The city has reinvented itself again in the 21st century. It's now one of America's most celebrated food destinations, with more restaurants per capita than almost any city in the country. The working waterfront still hauls lobster and clams, but now it shares the docks with craft breweries and oyster bars.

> "Portland is what happens when a fishing village decides it also wants to be Brooklyn, but keeps the lobster boats." — A local, probably

**What makes it special:** The scale. You can walk from the art museum to a lobster shack to a craft cocktail bar in fifteen minutes. The ocean is always visible. The pace is unhurried.

## Local Lore

### The Great Fire of 1866

On July 4th, 1866, a firecracker (allegedly thrown by a boy) ignited a boatyard on Commercial Street. The fire consumed 1,500 buildings — nearly half the city. Portland rebuilt in brick, which is why the Old Port looks the way it does today.

### The Longfellow Connection

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow grew up here. His childhood home still stands on Congress Street. The city embraces its literary son with a statue in Longfellow Square and a general pride in poetry and the written word.

### Moxie: Maine's State Soft Drink

Before Coca-Cola, there was Moxie — a bitter, medicinal-tasting soda invented in 1884. Maine adopted it as the official state soft drink in 2005. You'll find it in every corner store. Most visitors hate it. Locals consider this a point of pride.

### Lobster Lore

Maine lobstermen haul about 100 million pounds of lobster each year. The industry is tightly regulated — lobsters too small or too large must be thrown back, and egg-bearing females are notched and returned. It's sustainable by tradition, not just regulation.

## 3 Dishes to Try

### 1. Lobster Roll

The classic Maine lobster roll is served cold — chunks of fresh lobster in light mayo on a buttered, split-top hot dog bun. Don't let anyone convince you the Connecticut (warm butter) version is better. This is Maine.

**Where:** Eventide Oyster Co. for a twist (brown butter, bao bun) or Highroller for the classic.

### 2. Wild Maine Blueberry Pie

Maine's tiny wild blueberries are intensely flavored — nothing like the bland cultivated ones. A good blueberry pie here uses barely any sugar and lets the berries speak. The crust should shatter.

**Where:** Two Fat Cats Bakery or Standard Baking Co.

### 3. Oysters on the Half Shell

The cold, clean waters of Casco Bay and the Damariscotta River produce some of the best oysters on the East Coast. Briny, plump, and best eaten with nothing more than a squeeze of lemon.

**Where:** Eventide Oyster Co. (the oyster happy hour is legendary)
